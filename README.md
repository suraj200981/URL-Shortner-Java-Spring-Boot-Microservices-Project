# URL-Shortner-Java-Spring-Boot-Microservices-Project

## Introduction:

This is a project i have created based on a nodejs project i created for fun a while back: https://github.com/suraj200981/URLShortener--Full-Stack-MEVN-Project

This old nodejs project had a monolithic architecture so i have decided to recreate it with a modern microservices architecture.
